I had a programming competition against a buddy to see who could solve the problem
of turning a number "532" into a string "five hundred thirty-two" faster. Since, 
I cleaned up the code and added more functionality

LatinUnits.java only holds a list of units (thousand, million, etc)
NumToWord.java has all application logic

Currently supports any number between one millimillion and
negative one millimillion with less than 3007 characters past the decimal
